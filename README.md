# TransportTest
Just testing some transportation belts

Made this in 3 days within only a single script cuz i didn't feel like making another one lol

There is a bug that doesn't allow you to move the box properly when it's being transported, idk how to fix that without rewriting the movement system(which it's such a dumb bug i didn't feel like it), it probably won't affect stuff on gameplay...probably

feel free to use this on comercial projects
